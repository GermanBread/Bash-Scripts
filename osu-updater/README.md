# Osu!Lazer updater

This script checks for Osu!Lazer updates and downloads them automagically

## I want to play, how do I install this thing without downloading the whole repo?

Easy, just paste `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GermanBread/Bash-Scripts/master/osu-updater/updater.sh | bash` in terminal.

## How to use?

By default this script will update Osu!Lazer and then start it. 
If you do not want this behaviour, provide "nostart" as an argument.
