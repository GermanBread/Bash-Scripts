# Windows 10 KVM starter

## Warning

* This script assumes a vm named "win10"
* Your password gets cached in /tmp/

## Okay, I read the warning, how do I use this?

Paste `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GermanBread/Bash-Scripts/master/windows-vm-starter/windows_vm_starter.sh | bash` in terminal and have fun!
